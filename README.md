I took the Coursera's "Functional Programming in Scala" online MOOC (https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) taught by Martin Odersky. My course session was from Aug - Sep 2017.

This repository contains my solutions to all the programming exercises. The solutions are 100% correct and received a perfect grading of 10/10 from the online grader.
